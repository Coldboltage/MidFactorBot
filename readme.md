Simple Readme for myself

* Grab both Midnite and Factorgg info. DONE
* Grab amount of money on Midnite. Cheerio should help with this
* Learn how to input information. Can't see this being too difficult
* Save results into a database. Create Schema and model and push onto it

From here, I'd have to assumt I can start building out the API routes which I'll use Express for while using NodeJS to learn to Express. 

NOTE: Will need to look at the dates of both Midnite and Factorgg. 
NOTE: Will need to consider the need of a frontend. I will be setting up API's so I will be able to see previous information. This will require CLIENT/SERVER folders

BIG NOTE: index.js will execute the script and it will have cascading affect

17th April: Will create the backend first so then I know what to make for the frontend.
